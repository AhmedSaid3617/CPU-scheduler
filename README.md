# CPU Scheduler Simulator

A GUI-based desktop application that visually simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms in real-time. This project demonstrates how operating systems manage process execution using different scheduling techniques, featuring:

- **4 Algorithm Types**: FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin (with preemptive variants)
- **Interactive Visualization**: Live Gantt chart and dynamic statistics
- **Flexible Execution**: Supports both batch processing and live scheduling with dynamic process insertion

Perfect for OS education, algorithm analysis, or scheduling behavior demonstration.
